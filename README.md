Autonomous Drone Project


Our drone is a senior design project in Texas A&M- Electrical and computer engineering department. Our Drone will be able to catch any other unwanted drone using a radar on the ground. Then Drone will fly toward the other drone and catch using a net thats located underneath our drone. The drone has also a wireless charging station.
