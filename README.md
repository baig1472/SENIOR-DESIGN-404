# SENIOR-DESIGN-404
Autonomous Drone Project


Our drone is a senior design project in Texas A&M- Electrical and computer engineering department. Our Drone will be able to catch any other unwanted drone using a radar on the ground. Then Drone will fly toward the other drone and catch it using a net thats located underneath our drone. we also built a wireless charging station to charge the battery wirelessly.
