Start to look at circuit analysis to figure out how to wire Raspberry Pi points with PCB protoypes 


Week 4- Update

Soldered 4 sensors to Raspberry Pi sensors
Looked into Google cloud based image processing, made google cloud account

Week 5- Update 

Integrating Raspberry Pi ultrasonic sensors with drone system

Week 6- Update

Google cloud based image processing with raspberry pi and it's camera did not quite work to our expectations.
