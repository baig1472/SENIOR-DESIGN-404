The charging Station is Working properly
the output voltage i get was 5V 
the output current i get was depending on the distance between the transmitter and receiver
i chose the distance to be 20 mm as it transmit the maximum output current (2A) 
The output current if the distance get further will decreased ( at 70mm i get 100 mA)

Performing multiple tests
Recording accepted test ( from ideal voltage 11.1V to max voltage 11.8V) 

Week 9- update

Further tests were performed
validating results (from fully discharged to fully charged 90.2V to 11.8V)
