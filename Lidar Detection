Week 1

tested the system to check if it detects distances (403 demo) 
mounted another servo motor to allow better angle detection and mounted the sensor on these motors 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 2

Orded a wire slip ring to prevent wire twisting of the sensor while it moves, and a wifi shield to transmit data to other subsystems.
cut and soldered the wires to prepare it for connecting to the PCB and to the Arduino. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 3

got a PCB prototype from a team member and soldered the required circuit on it along with some pins to allow wire connection. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 4

Worked the math to convert the distances measured by the Lidar sensor to GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 5

Finished bolting the entire system on a box that contains the Arduino and the PCB and wires inside. 
started coding the formulas along with the changes required to make to the original code (code used to demo for 403) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 6

were able to get a latitude and longitude after a lot of debugging. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 7

changed the algorithm for getting a GPS location after meeting with Mutaz at the blitz. The algorithm is then validated. I had to make
conversions betwwen UTM and Longitude and Latitude to apply the math. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 8

verified the minimum amount of movement the step motor can make and it turned out to be ~0.33 degrees and the error of distance readings at
40 m is ~10-30 cm. this tells us that the arclength at 40 m is 23cm with means that the targeted drone should have more than 23cm 
dimenssions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 9 

tested detection in the field and workd on hooking the wifi sheild to communicate with the pi
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 10

worked on converting UTM readings to latitude and longitude. also helped the drone teamate to rebuild the drone after crashing. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 11 

system is fully integrated via putty and the pi is getting the GPS readings from the lidar detection system.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 12
