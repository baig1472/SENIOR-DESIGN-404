Week 1

tested the system to check if it detects distances (403 demo) 
mounted another servo motor to allow better angle detection and mounted the sensor on these motors 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 2

Orded a wire slip ring to prevent wire twisting of the sensor while it moves, and a wifi shield to transmit data to other subsystems.
cut and soldered the wires to prepare it for connecting to the PCB and to the Arduino. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 3

got a PCB prototype from a team member and soldered the required circuit on it along with some pins to allow wire connection. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 4

Worked the math to convert the distances measured by the Lidar sensor to GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 5

Finished bolting the entire system on a box that contains the Arduino and the PCB and wires inside. 
started coding the formulas along with the changes required to make to the original code (code used to demo for 403) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 6

were able to get a latitude and longitude after a lot of debugging.
